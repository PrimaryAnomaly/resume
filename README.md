**Building resilient, autonomous infrastructure for first-generation Mars colonies.**

Everything I work on—embedded systems, space hardware, pharmaceutical process control—is a stepping stone toward making humans a multi-planetary species. CubeSat payloads teach us to build compact, fault-tolerant systems. Freeze-drying research enables medicine production in extreme environments. Satellite integration proves out the testing rigor needed for life-critical systems.
